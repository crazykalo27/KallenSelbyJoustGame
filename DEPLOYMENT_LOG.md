# Joust Game Deployment Log

## Project Status
âœ… **Java JAR Created Successfully**
âœ… **Performance Optimized for Smooth Gameplay**

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Setup
- Retrieved correct source code from `git@github.com:rhit-csse220/csse220-spring-2023-final-project-s23_a303.git`
- Overwrote existing incorrect code in local repository
- Pushed correct code to personal repository `git@github.com:crazykalo27/KallenSelbyJoustGame.git`

### 2. Java 11 Compatibility Fixes
- **File**: `src/main/java/mainApp/LeftRightEnemy.java`
- **Issue**: `Random.nextInt(min, max)` method only available in Java 17+
- **Fix**: Replaced with `Random.nextInt(range) + min` pattern
  - Line 26: `r.nextInt(40, 90)` â†’ `r.nextInt(50) + 40`
  - Line 46: `r.nextInt(50, 100)` â†’ `r.nextInt(50) + 50`

### 3. JAR File Creation
- Compiled Java sources to `bin/` directory
- Created `MANIFEST.MF` with Main-Class specification
- Generated `JoustGame.jar` with entry point `mainApp.MainApp`
- Organized level files in `levels/` directory

### 4. Testing
- JAR file runs successfully on Java 11
- Game window opens and displays correctly

### 5. ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations (NEW)
**Dramatically improved game smoothness and responsiveness:**

#### Frame Rate Improvements
- **GameViewer.java**: Increased from 25 FPS to ~60 FPS
  - `DELAY = 40ms` â†’ `DELAY = 16ms`

#### Movement Speed Enhancements
- **MoveableObject.java**: Core movement system optimized
  - `DEFAULT_MAX_SPEED = 10` â†’ `DEFAULT_MAX_SPEED = 18` (+80% increase)
  - `GRAVITY_STRENGTH = 0.5` â†’ `GRAVITY_STRENGTH = 0.8` (+60% for responsive jumps)
  - `FRICTION_STRENGTH = 0.5` â†’ `FRICTION_STRENGTH = 0.25` (-50% for snappier movement)

#### Hero Responsiveness
- **Hero.java**: Player control optimized
  - Up key velocity: `-8` â†’ `-12` (+50% for better flying response)
- **FileReader.java**: Hero speed initialization
  - Hero speed: `1` â†’ `3.5` (+250% for much more responsive movement)

#### Enemy AI Speed
- **FileReader.java**: Enemy movement optimized
  - Ghost enemies: `4` â†’ `5.5` (+37.5% speed)
  - Koopa enemies: `2` â†’ `3` (+50% speed)
  - Tracker enemies: `2.0` â†’ `3.5` (+75% speed)
- **LeftRightEnemy.java**: Removed artificial speed reduction
  - Removed `*.6` speed modifier for smoother enemy movement

#### Collision Response
- **GameComponent.java**: More natural collision physics
  - `bounceStrength = 99999999` â†’ `bounceStrength = 25` (natural bounce response)

#### Performance Impact Summary
- **Frame rate**: 25 FPS â†’ 60 FPS (140% improvement)
- **Input lag**: Significantly reduced with higher update rate
- **Movement smoothness**: Dramatically improved across all entities
- **Game feel**: Much more responsive and fluid gameplay

## Next Steps for JavaScript Conversion
The Java game is now running optimally with smooth 60 FPS gameplay. Key components identified for JS conversion:
- **Game Loop**: `GameComponent` class handles main game logic
- **Entities**: Hero, Enemy types, Platform, Egg classes
- **Input**: Key handling for player movement
- **Graphics**: Java2D rendering that will need Canvas API equivalent
- **Level Loading**: File reading system for level data
