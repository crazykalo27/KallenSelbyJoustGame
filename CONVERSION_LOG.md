# Joust Game Java to JavaScript Conversion Log

## Overview
Converting Java Swing-based Joust game to JavaScript/HTML5 for web browser compatibility.

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL: Platform Method Naming Conflict (Latest Fix - 2024-06-28)**
**Issue**: `platform.isLava is not a function` error breaking collision detection completely
**Root Cause**: 
- JavaScript Platform class had naming conflict between properties and methods
- Constructor set `this.isLava = false` (property) but also defined `isLava()` method
- When method tried to return `this.isLava === true`, it referenced the property, not the method
- Platform objects in collision detection didn't have the expected methods

**Fixes Applied**:
- Renamed internal properties to use underscore prefixes (`_isLava`, `_isIce`, `_isSlime`, `_isCool`)
- Added `SetCool()` method (capital S) to match Java version exactly
- Methods now properly return the renamed internal properties
- Fixed collision detection to call `platform.SetCool(false)` instead of `setCool(false)`

**Current Status**: Platform collision detection should now work - hero should stop when hitting platforms instead of passing through

### 1.1. **Major Speed Reduction & Ghost Behavior Fix (2024-06-28)**
**Issue**: All game entities moving too fast, ghost enemy not behaving like original Java version
**Root Cause**: 
- All speeds were too fast for comfortable gameplay
- JavaScript LeftRightEnemy was completely different from Java implementation
- Ghost should float (no gravity) and move in timed patterns, not simple left-right

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Speed Reductions** (all reduced to 1/3 of original):
  - Hero: 3.0 → 1.0
  - Ghost: 5.5 → 1.8  
  - Koopa: 3.0 → 1.0
  - Tracker: 3.5 → 1.2
- **Ghost Behavior Fix**:
  - Added `setHasGravity(false)` - ghosts now float
  - Implemented timed direction changes (40-89 ticks initially, 50-99 after)
  - Added Y-velocity changes when switching direction
  - Used squared speed for movement (matches Java exactly)
  - Direction reversal by negating speed

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All entities should move at comfortable speeds, ghost should behave like original

### 1.2. **Major Enemy Behavior & Egg Physics Fixes (2024-06-28)**
**Issue**: Koopa enemies, Tracker enemies, and Egg physics not matching original Java behavior
**Root Cause**: 
- Koopa (RandomMoveEnemy) was moving in random circles instead of jumping and changing direction on wall hits
- Tracker was using normalized movement instead of distance-based velocity (no slowdown when closer)
- Tracker had gravity when it should float
- Egg wasn't affected by gravity
- Player speed still too fast

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Player Speed**: Further reduced from 1.0 to 0.5 for optimal control
- **Koopa Behavior** (matches Java exactly):
  - Added gravity (falls naturally)
  - Random jumping with 2% chance per frame (`addYVelocity(-20)`)
  - Horizontal movement in current direction
  - Direction reversal on wall collision
  - Speed multiplier of 1.5x applied in constructor
- **Tracker Behavior** (matches Java exactly):
  - Removed gravity (floats)
  - Distance-based movement: velocity = distance * -0.03 (creates natural slowdown)
  - Minimum speed multiplier when velocity < 2
  - Set size to 50x50 pixels (matches Java)
- **Egg Physics** (matches Java exactly):
  - Changed from GameObject to MoveableObject
  - Added gravity (eggs fall and rest on platforms)
  - Standard collision physics
  - Size set to 20x20 pixels

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All entities should now behave exactly like original Java version

### 1.3. **Physics Fine-Tuning for Better Control (2024-06-28)**
**Issue**: Upward thrust too strong for gentle control, gravity slightly too strong
**Root Cause**: Original Java values (-12 thrust, 0.8 gravity) felt too aggressive for precise control

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Upward Velocity**: Reduced from -12 to -6, then to -3 (75% total reduction for very gentle lift)
- **Upward Speed Cap**: Added custom cap of 8 (vs default 18) for maximum upward velocity
- **Gravity Strength**: Reduced from 0.8 to 0.6 (25% reduction for more floaty feel)

**Expected Result**: Very precise, controllable flying with limited top speed - gentle acceleration and capped velocity
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Hero should now have much more controllable flying physics

### 1.4. **Final Movement Fine-Tuning (2024-06-28)**
**Issue**: Koopa jumps too high/fast, player upward force still slightly too much, no horizontal speed cap
**Fixes Applied**:
- **Player Upward Force**: Reduced from -3 to -2 (even gentler)
- **Player Horizontal Speed Cap**: Added cap of 10 (vs default 18) for left/right movement
- **Koopa Jump Force**: Reduced from -20 to -12 (40% reduction)
- **Koopa Speed Multiplier**: Reduced from 1.5x to 1.2x for better control

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All movement should now feel perfectly balanced

### 1.5. **Gravity Fine-Tuning (2024-06-28)**
**Issue**: Gravity still slightly too strong for comfortable gameplay
**Fix Applied**:
- **Gravity Strength**: Reduced from 0.6 to 0.5 (final gentle adjustment)

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Perfect gravity balance achieved

### 2. **Previous Critical Collision System Bug (Fixed)**
**Issue**: `platform.isLava is not a function` error breaking collision detection
**Root Cause**: 
- Collision system was failing due to improper error handling
- Platform instances weren't being validated properly before method calls
- Previous position calculation was causing collision direction errors

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added comprehensive instanceof checks for Platform objects
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging for non-Platform objects
- Improved collision debugging to track exact collision scenarios
- Added validation for null/undefined platforms in arrays
- Removed try-catch blocks that were masking underlying issues
- Enhanced Hero collision logging to match Java behavior exactly

**Current Status**: Collision system now has robust error handling and debugging

### 3. **Previous Position Bug (Fixed)**
**Issue**: Hero falling through platforms
**Root Cause**: Previous position initialized to (0,0) instead of spawn position
**Fix**: Changed initialization from (0,0) to (xCent, yCent) in MoveableObject constructor

### 4. **Level Loading Issues (Fixed)**
**Issue**: Auto-advancing to level 11, empty levels
**Root Cause**: Win condition triggering on empty arrays
**Fix**: Added gameObjects.length > 0 check in win condition

### 5. **Speed Calibration (Fixed)**
**Issue**: Movement too fast/slow
**Fix**: Restored original Java speeds - Hero 3.5, enemies as specified

### 6. **Carriage Return Handling (Fixed)**
**Issue**: Windows line endings breaking level parsing
**Fix**: Strip \r characters in LevelLoader

## Technical Implementation

### Physics System
- **Gravity**: 0.8 (matches Java)
- **Friction**: 0.25 (matches Java)
- **Max Speed**: 18 (matches Java)
- **Coordinate Scale**: 50px per grid unit

### Collision Detection

- Joust mechanics: height-based combat system

### Level System
