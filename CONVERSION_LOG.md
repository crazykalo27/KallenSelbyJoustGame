# Joust Game Java to JavaScript Conversion Log

## Overview
Converting Java Swing-based Joust game to JavaScript/HTML5 for web browser compatibility.

## Major Issues Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL: Platform Method Naming Conflict (Latest Fix - 2024-06-28)**
**Issue**: `platform.isLava is not a function` error breaking collision detection completely
**Root Cause**: 
- JavaScript Platform class had naming conflict between properties and methods
- Constructor set `this.isLava = false` (property) but also defined `isLava()` method
- When method tried to return `this.isLava === true`, it referenced the property, not the method
- Platform objects in collision detection didn't have the expected methods

**Fixes Applied**:
- Renamed internal properties to use underscore prefixes (`_isLava`, `_isIce`, `_isSlime`, `_isCool`)
- Added `SetCool()` method (capital S) to match Java version exactly
- Methods now properly return the renamed internal properties
- Fixed collision detection to call `platform.SetCool(false)` instead of `setCool(false)`

**Current Status**: Platform collision detection should now work - hero should stop when hitting platforms instead of passing through

### 1.1. **Hero Speed Adjustment (2024-06-28)**
**Issue**: Hero movement speed slightly too fast for optimal gameplay
**Fix**: Reduced hero speed from 3.5 to 3.0 for better control and gameplay feel
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### 2. **Previous Critical Collision System Bug (Fixed)**
**Issue**: `platform.isLava is not a function` error breaking collision detection
**Root Cause**: 
- Collision system was failing due to improper error handling
- Platform instances weren't being validated properly before method calls
- Previous position calculation was causing collision direction errors

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added comprehensive instanceof checks for Platform objects
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging for non-Platform objects
- Improved collision debugging to track exact collision scenarios
- Added validation for null/undefined platforms in arrays
- Removed try-catch blocks that were masking underlying issues
- Enhanced Hero collision logging to match Java behavior exactly

**Current Status**: Collision system now has robust error handling and debugging

### 3. **Previous Position Bug (Fixed)**
**Issue**: Hero falling through platforms
**Root Cause**: Previous position initialized to (0,0) instead of spawn position
**Fix**: Changed initialization from (0,0) to (xCent, yCent) in MoveableObject constructor

### 4. **Level Loading Issues (Fixed)**
**Issue**: Auto-advancing to level 11, empty levels
**Root Cause**: Win condition triggering on empty arrays
**Fix**: Added gameObjects.length > 0 check in win condition

### 5. **Speed Calibration (Fixed)**
**Issue**: Movement too fast/slow
**Fix**: Restored original Java speeds - Hero 3.5, enemies as specified

### 6. **Carriage Return Handling (Fixed)**
**Issue**: Windows line endings breaking level parsing
**Fix**: Strip \r characters in LevelLoader

## Technical Implementation

### Physics System
- **Gravity**: 0.8 (matches Java)
- **Friction**: 0.25 (matches Java)
- **Max Speed**: 18 (matches Java)
- **Coordinate Scale**: 50px per grid unit

### Collision Detection
- Rectangle intersection-based
- Direction calculated from previous position
- Platform effects: lava (death), ice (acceleration), slime (stop), health (extra life)
- Joust mechanics: height-based combat system

### Level System
- 13 levels (0-12), level 0 is tutorial
- Text-based level format with character mapping
- Dynamic enemy spawning as eggs after death

## Completed Features

### Core Architecture ✅
- **GameObject.js**: Base class for all game objects with collision detection, positioning, and basic game object functionality
- **MoveableObject.js**: Physics-enabled base class with gravity, friction, velocity system, and sprite rendering
- **Hero.js**: Player character with keyboard controls and joust mechanics
- **Enemy.js**: Base enemy class with three subtypes:
  - LeftRightEnemy (Ghost type) - moves horizontally
  - RandomMoveEnemy (Koopa type) - random movement pattern
  - Tracker - follows the player
- **Platform.js**: Static platforms with special properties (normal, lava, ice, slime, health)
- **Egg.js**: Spawned when enemies die, respawns enemies after 7 seconds
- **LevelLoader.js**: Parses level text files and creates game objects
- **GameEngine.js**: Main game loop, collision detection, input handling, and rendering
- **main.js**: Game initialization

### Game Mechanics ✅
- **Physics System**: Gravity, friction, velocity limits, collision response
- **Joust Combat**: Height-based combat system where higher player wins
- **Platform Types**: 
  - Normal platforms (gray)
  - Lava platforms (kill player, red)
  - Ice platforms (increase slip, blue)
  - Slime platforms (stop movement, green)
  - Health platforms (add life, yellow)
- **Enemy AI**: Three different movement patterns for variety
